# React Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript + React hooks and functional components where possible
- No new dependencies without approval
- On new React components first create the unit test and then implement the component
- Propose for every new React component visual regression test
- Use single quotes as default

# Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Indentation: 2 spaces; keep JSX props vertically aligned when multi-line
- Filenames: PascalCase for components (`ForecastList.tsx`), camelCase for non-components (`weatherUtils.ts`)
- Linting: ESLint via `eslint.config.js`; fix lint before committing

# Setup Commands (add custom params to justify next explicit calls)
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm dev`
- Run tests: `npm test`
