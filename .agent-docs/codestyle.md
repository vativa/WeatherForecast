# React coding standards
- Use React hooks and functional components where possible
- No new dependencies without approval
- On new React components first create the unit test and then implement the component
- Propose for every new React component visual regression test
- Use single quotes as default

# Setup commands (add custom params to justify next explicit calls)
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm dev`
- Run tests: `npm test`
